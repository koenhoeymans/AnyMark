Transformation test
-------------------

A regular paragraph with *emphasized* and _italic_ text in. It is followed by a list:

* item, with *emphasized* text and escaped \*emphasized\* text
* item, with **strong** text and escaped *\*strong\** text

!note
	A note can span
multiple lines. Let's create a note in a note:

	!note
		a subnote with a list

		* item with an ![image test](http://example.com "example image")
		* item

	And now we're in our parent note again.

!note
	A note following a note.

 * Item, with _italic_ text and a paragraph.

   The next paragraph in this item.

 * item, with a [link reference] [1]
 * other [link reference] [2]

!note
	A note starting unindented. With a [relative] [3] link.

A code example. It can be used to display code:

	<?php // code goes here ?>
	<i>html goes here</i>

Code inline uses `backticks` but...

	~~~
		code can also use tildes and display html
		<a>element</a>
	~~~

Let's try a short definition list:

term A
:	First paragraph of explanation of term.

	Second paragraph of explanation of term.

term B
:	explanation of term

	* listitem in term B
	* other listitem

This is another paragraph with an email link <mail@example.com>. It uses AT&T as in the
Markdown manual. The ampersand is translated in http://url.com?a=1&b=2 but not in &copy;. Another special
character is < and >: 4<5 or 4 < 5 should use entities.  
Previous line had two spaces for a line break.

> a blockquote can contain a blockquote
>
> > a subblockquote
>
> and code
>
> 	> indented code for blockquote

 * * *

Let's end with code indented:

	code example with <b>html</b> in it
	also with </code>
	tag

The link definitions below disappear.
